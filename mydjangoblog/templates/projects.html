			<p>Team Project AI â€“ Artificial Intelligence based Video Game</p>
			<p>The World Below</p>
			<p>A 2D Platformer game based on the myth of Orpheus and Eurydice in which the character has to face several level, enemies and a final boss. The difficulty of the game depends on the character ability and knowledge, at the end of every level the player will be given questions from the Artificial Intelligence that is personified by Ares,the player has to respond and a Sentiment Analysis will be applied to interpret and classify the emotions within text data using text analysis technique. According to the classification the next level of th game could become harder with more enemies, powerful enemies, challenging and longer level or it could become a little bit easier.</p>
			<p>Thanks to the combined effort of the team we were able to design,implement and document the whole project. Build the graphics and made use of state-of-the-art AI Programming, applied good software engineering practice, using industry-standard approaches such as continuous integration, sharing code with github and weekly meetings. </p>

			<p>Evolutionary Algorithm</p>
			<p>University assignment</p>
			<p>The algorithm is based on the biological evolutionary process.
			The algorithm starts with a random generation of individuals. Each individual has its fitness, which is the measure of how close It is to the desired result. Calculation of fitness varies from case to case. Once all the individuals are defined we assigned the fitness and sort the population according to it, then we apply the process of Mutation to the each individual but according to a certain probability.
			Mutation involves changing one or more values of a character. The new value must come from the legal set of values. After some of the individuals have mutated, some of the most fit individual are taken to produce new individuals that will be called children, this will be done using crossing-over with a certain probability. 
			The crossover operation is a simple array copying, we take two parents at a time and a random index is generated, we will then use that index to divide the gene of the individuals in two parts. The first part of parent1 is combined with the second part of parent2 and vice versa, in this way we will produce two completely new individuals and with some probability most of them will have a greater fitness.

			To maintain the population size, we remove the worst individuals in the population and add the children. Of course this only happens if the children are not the worst individuals. The whole population will soon be replaced and all these steps are repeated until either the best individual is found or the number of times the algorithm ran on the population exceeds the given limit.
</p>
			<p>The best individual has the maximum fitness possible that varies according to the number of genes and this particular target is set by the user.
			Marks Obtained: 100/100</p>

			<p>Maze solving and tracking robot</p>
			<p>Implementing A* algorithm</p>
			<p>Programming a robot that has to solve the maze assigned using Java.
			the aim of the robot is to map the whole maze that is a 2D array,go back to the first tale and find the shortest path to reach the end as quickly as possible,avoiding walls and some particular tale that the robot cannot cross.</p>
			<p>This project involved the assemblation of the robot with motiv traction and sensors,the implementation of a searching alghorithm and the representation of the map and the path taken in the console.</p>

			<p>PCAAAA</p>
			<p>PCA REPORT</p>
			<p>The objective of the project is to apply Principal Components Analysis (PCA) to a dataset and interpret the result. In this case the dataset that I chose regards Coronavirus cases in Italy. I wrote a report describing what is PCA,describing the dataset,making expectation about the results,choosing the dimensions to label the data,applying pre-processing to the whole dataset,calculating the covariance matrix,showed eigenvalues and eigenvectors and project all the data onto the plane. </p>

			<p>Digital Image Processor</p>
			<p>Image Processing Tool</p>
			<p>Image processing involves amending the color values of the pixels in an image in some way, or creating a new image from an old one having processed the old one in some way. In these project i created and applied filters to images.
			A filter is a 2D array of values and so are the images in question. The filter is usually a small array, for example 3 rows by 3 columns (3x3) but the image is much more larger. The values in the filter are used to modify each pixel in the source image simply applying matrix moltiplication.</p>
			<p>Each single pixel in the source image is then modified by the entire filter.Filter used are Sepia,Greyscale,Identity,Blur,Sharpen,Edge,Emboss.</p>
